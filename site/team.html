It's not just some incremental improvements over the status quo, it redefines the state of the art. If you are a web developer, you should learn Lift. Even if you don't wind up using it everyday, it will change the way you approach web applications.</h5>

            <p>An awful lot of time and effort has gone into making lift the great 
              bit of software it is today - so, to honor this effort, we felt it only
              right to honor those who have generously donated time to the project.</p>
